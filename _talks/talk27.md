name: Attractors for locally damped Bresse systems
speakers: [Rodrigo Monteiro (UEL)]
---

This present talk is devoted to Bresse systems, a robust model for circular beams, given by a set of three coupled wave equations. The main objective is to establish the existence of global attractors for dynamics of semilinear problems with localized damping. In order to deal with localized damping a unique continuation property (UCP) is needed. Therefore we also provide a suitable UCP for Bresse systems.
