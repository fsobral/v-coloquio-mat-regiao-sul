A new algorithm for solving non-homogeneous asymptotically linear and superlinear elliptic problems is proposed. The ground state solution of the problem, which in general is obtained as a min-max of the associated functional, is obtained as the minimum of the functional constrained to the Pohozaev manifold instead. Examples are given of the use of this method for finding numerical solutions depending on various parameters.  This is work in collaboration with R. Ruviaro, Y.D. Sobral, and D. Raom, Departamento de Matemática, Universidade de Brasília, Brazil.
