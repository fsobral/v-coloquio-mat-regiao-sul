name: Properties of solutions to the fifth-order KdV-BBM equation
speakers: [Xavier Carvajal (UFRJ)]
---

We study some properties of the fifth-order KdV-BBM model, we consider the propagation of regularities and evolution of radius of analyticity of the solutions, also the well-posedness, ill-posedness and norm-inflation in the periodic case and the well-posedness, ill-posedness in the real case.
