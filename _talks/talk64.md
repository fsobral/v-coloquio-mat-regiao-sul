In this talk I will discuss Calder\'on-Zygmund theory results for multi-layer potential operators associated with homogeneous constant coefficient higher order systems in uniformly rectifiable domains in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$ and applications to Fredholm theory for boundary value problems. This is a joint work with P. Liboni (UEL-Brazil), D. Mitrea (Baylor Univ.), I. Mitrea (Temple Univ.) and M. Mitrea (Baylor Univ.).
