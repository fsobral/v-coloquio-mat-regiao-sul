In this talk we will discuss the classification of invariant Einstein metrics on real flag manifolds associated to simple and non-compact split real forms of complex classical Lie algebras whose isotropy representation decomposes into two or three irreducible sub-representations. We also discuss some phenomena in real flag manifolds that can not happen in complex flag manifolds. This includes the non-existence of invariant Einstein metric and examples of non-diagonal Einstein metrics. This is a joint work with Brian Grajales.
